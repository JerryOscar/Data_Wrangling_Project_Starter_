# Real-world Data Wrangling
In this project, you will apply the skills you acquired in the course to gather and wrangle real-world data with two datasets of your choice.

You will retrieve and extract the data, assess the data programmatically and visually, accross elements of data quality and structure, and implement a cleaning strategy for the data. You will then store the updated data into your selected database/data store, combine the data, and answer a research question with the datasets.

Throughout the process, you are expected to:

Explain your decisions towards methods used for gathering, assessing, cleaning, storing, and answering the research question
Write code comments so your code is more readable
1. Gather data
In this section, you will extract data using two different data gathering methods and combine the data. Use at least two different types of data-gathering methods.

Programmatically downloading file 'Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_Data'
Download data manually 'Traffic_Violations'
1.1. Problem Statement
In this project, I will investigate whether certain car makes and models are more likely to be involved in traffic violations and crashes. I will analyze data from two datasets: one focusing on traffic violations and the other on crash reports. By comparing vehicle characteristics across these datasets, I aim to identify any trends that could help improve road safety measures.

1.2. Gather at least two datasets using two different data gathering methods
